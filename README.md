# echo-server


This is a simple Echo Server using Express as Backend and React, Axios, HTML, CSS in the Front-End

This is intended to be run in a server. The Express server is in echoServer.js and run via nodemon / babel-node in the package.json (build-run) target.

1) The server accepts no value to be echoed and will return "No Message Received", otherwise a JavaScript alert will appear with the value provided, echoed back.

2) The Echo Server listens on port 8080, localhost, hard-coded in echoServer.js at the moment.

3) The Echo Server can also be interacted with directly using something like CURL

&gt;curl localhost:8080/echo

<b>{"message":"No Message Received"}</b>

&gt;curl localhost:8080/echo/foobar

<b>{"message":"foobar"}</b>

4) The Echo Server will also log the messages is receives from a client
<b>
Message Received: No Message Received

Message Received: foobar
</b>
